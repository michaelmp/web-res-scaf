============

Fast web resource prototyping web server.

# Rationale

I want an excuse to write an application using [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac).

# Features

The system exposes a web resource API for dynamically creating new web resources.

Resources do not need to be well-defined, as long as they are human-comprehensible for machine-assisted interaction.

REST is a starting-point.
